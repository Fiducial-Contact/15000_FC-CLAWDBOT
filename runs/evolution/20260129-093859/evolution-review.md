## 60s Questions (choose A/B/C...)

1) Do you want to optimize skills based on this run?
   A. Yes, propose a patch now (recommend using skill-improver first to generate minimal patch)
   B. Record the issue first, optimize later
   C. Not needed

2) What was the biggest blocker this time?
   A. Missing input/context fields (need clearer I/O contracts)
   B. Unclear plan/granularity too large (need to split or clarify validation steps)
   C. Environment/dependency/command issues (need scripting or fixed commands)
   D. UI/design iterations (need clearer design-system or UI subtask splitting)
   E. External service/permissions/configuration (need clearer confirmation points and verification)
   F. Other (explain in one sentence)

3) Which direction do you want to prioritize for optimization?
   A. I/O contracts: Fix artifact names, fields, paths
   B. Index/summary: Less context, better resume navigation (proposal/tasks)
   C. Scripts/templates: Turn repetitive steps into deterministic scripts
   D. Confirmation points: Reduce risky actions, confirm earlier/more clearly

## If you choose 1A

- Next step: run `skill-improver` using one of:
  - /Users/studio01/Documents/HH/HH_Project/15000_FC-CLAWDBOT-main/runs/evolution/20260129-093859  (evolution run_dir)
- Then apply the minimal patch manually.
