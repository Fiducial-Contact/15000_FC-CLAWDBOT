description: "Scaffold a new OpenSpec change and validate strictly."

先分析当前对话我们正在谈的问题涉及多少个部分 每个部分需要单独立案单独的文件夹，方便管理，但是内容需要关联和描述一定要清晰和完整上下文。

创建完之后 中文大白话解释 哪个先运行 有没有可以并发的，然后给出最先需要执行的 执行细则。
**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `openspec/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `openspec/` directory—run `ls openspec` or `openspec update` if you don't see it) if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications.
- Identify any vague or ambiguous details and ask the necessary follow-up questions before editing files.

**Steps**
1. Review `openspec/project.md`, run `openspec list` and `openspec list --specs`, and inspect related code or docs (e.g., via `rg`/`ls`) to ground the proposal in current behaviour; note any gaps that require clarification.
2. Choose a unique verb-led `change-id` and scaffold `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and `design.md` (when needed) under `openspec/changes/<id>/`.
3. Map the change into concrete capabilities or requirements, breaking multi-scope efforts into distinct spec deltas with clear relationships and sequencing.
4. Capture architectural reasoning in `design.md` when the solution spans multiple systems, introduces new patterns, or demands trade-off discussion before committing to specs.
5. Draft spec deltas in `changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (one folder per capability) using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement and cross-reference related capabilities when relevant.
6. Draft `tasks.md` as an ordered list of small, verifiable work items that deliver user-visible progress, include validation (tests, tooling), and highlight dependencies or parallelizable work.
7. Validate with `openspec validate <id> --strict` and resolve every issue before sharing the proposal.

**Reference**
- Use `openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only` or `openspec show <spec> --type spec` to inspect details when validation fails.
- Search existing requirements with `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" openspec/specs` before writing new ones.
- Explore the codebase with `rg <keyword>`, `ls`, or direct file reads so proposals align with current implementation realities.
